2. **SDK Adoption**
   - Risk: Developers don't use it
   - Mitigation: Excellent docs, examples, easy onboarding

3. **Scale Issues**
   - Risk: Can't handle production load
   - Mitigation: Early load testing, optimization

### Medium Risk Items
1. **PostHog API Changes**
   - Risk: Breaking changes
   - Mitigation: Version pinning, adapter pattern

2. **Competition**
   - Risk: Others build similar
   - Mitigation: Speed to market, unique AI features

---

## Open Questions

1. Should we support multiple log backends from the start or focus on PostHog?
   - **Decision:** Focus on PostHog initially, abstract later

2. Python vs Rust for the backend service?
   - **Decision:** Python for speed, Rust later if needed

3. How much telemetry should we collect from SDKs?
   - **Decision:** TBD in Sprint 7, privacy-first approach

4. Should we open source from day one?
   - **Decision:** Yes, build in public for transparency

---

## Review & Update Cadence

- **Every sprint:** Adjust upcoming sprint based on learnings
- **Every month:** Review milestones and timeline
- **Every quarter:** Major strategic review

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-09  
**Next Review:** 2025-01-23 (End of Sprint 1)
