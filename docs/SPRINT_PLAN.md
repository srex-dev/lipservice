## How to Use This Plan

### At Sprint Start (Every 2 weeks)
1. Review upcoming sprint tasks
2. Break down into daily work items
3. Set realistic goals

### During Sprint (Daily)
1. Pick 1-2 tasks to work on
2. Code, test, document
3. Commit progress
4. Update checkboxes

### At Sprint End (Every 2 weeks)
1. Demo what you built
2. Review what worked / didn't
3. Adjust next sprint if needed
4. Celebrate wins! üéâ

### Monthly Review
1. Check overall progress
2. Adjust timeline if needed
3. Update stakeholders (if any)

---

## Flexible Timeline

This is a **guideline**, not a deadline. It's okay if:
- Sprints take 3 weeks instead of 2
- You skip a week for vacation
- You pivot based on learnings
- You add/remove features

**What matters:** Steady progress and learning
