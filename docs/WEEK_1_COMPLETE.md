### Git Workflow for Week 2
```bash
# Start of week
git checkout -b sprint/1-week-2

# During week - commit often
git add .
git commit -m "feat(docker): add docker-compose with postgres"
git push origin sprint/1-week-2

# End of week
git checkout main
git merge sprint/1-week-2
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Sprint 1 Complete: Project Setup"
git push origin main --tags
```
