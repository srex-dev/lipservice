## üìù Notes

### Decision: Build PostHog Exporters
**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Reason:** PostHog doesn't have SDK wrappers yet (beta checklist unchecked)  
**Impact:** LipService becomes complete solution, fills their gap  
**Status:** Added to Sprint 6

### SDK Language Priority
1. ‚úÖ Python (done in Sprint 5, add PostHog exporter in Sprint 6)
2. TypeScript/JavaScript (Sprint 7)
3. Go (Sprint 8, if demand)
4. Java/Ruby (only if PostHog users request)

---

## üî• Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
- None! All clear to proceed.

### Potential Risks
- **PostHog SDK release:** They might release official SDKs (we can layer on top or deprecate)
- **OTLP spec changes:** Protocol updates could require changes
- **Performance:** Need to validate <1ms overhead at scale

### Mitigation
- Monitor PostHog roadmap closely
- Keep exporters modular (easy to swap)
- Build on OpenTelemetry standards (stable)
